"""
In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a unionâ€“find data structure or mergeâ€“find set, 
is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets. Equivalently, it stores a partition 
of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their 
union), and finding a representative member of a set. The last operation allows to find out efficiently if any two 
elements are in the same or different sets.
