"""
In computer science, a segment tree, also known as a statistic tree, is a tree data structure used for storing
information about intervals, or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain a given point. It
is, in principle, a static structure; that is, it's a structure that cannot be modified once it's built. A similar
data structure is the interval tree. A segment tree for a set I of n intervals uses O(n log n) storage and can be
built in O(n log n) time. Segment trees support searching for all the intervals that contain a query point in time O(
log n + k), k being the number of retrieved intervals or segments.
